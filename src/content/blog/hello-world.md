Welcome to my blog. This is a sample post to show you how blog entries work.

## What I'll Write About

- Security research and CTF writeups
- Project updates and build logs
- Thoughts on privacy and infosec
- Random tinkering with microcontrollers and AI

## How This Site Works

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and hosted on CloudFlare Pages. All content is written in Markdown files that get compiled to static HTML.

To add a new post, I just create a new `.md` file in `src/content/blog/` with frontmatter like this:

```yaml

title: "Post Title"
description: "Brief description"
date: 2024-12-30
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

Simple and fast.
